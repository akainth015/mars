 * These are the MIPS-defined formats of basic machine instructions.  The R-format indicates
 * the instruction works only with registers.  The I-format indicates the instruction
 * works with an immediate value (e.g. constant).  The J-format indicates this is a Jump
 * instruction.  The I-branch-format is defined by me, not MIPS, to to indicate this is
 * a Branch instruction, specifically to distinguish immediate
 * values used as target addresses.
